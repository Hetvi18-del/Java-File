   ```

2. **Open in Browser**
   - Simply open `index.html` in your web browser
   - Or use a local web server for better performance:
   
   **Using Python:**
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
   Then visit `http://localhost:8000`
   
   **Using Node.js:**
   ```bash
   npx serve .
   ```

3. **Start Using DocuChain**
   - The website will load with sample documents
   - Create an account or use as anonymous user
   - Upload documents and start verifying!

## üí° How to Use

### Uploading Documents
1. Click "Upload Document" or navigate to the Dashboard section
2. Drag files to the upload area or click "Choose Files"
3. Supported formats: PDF, DOC, DOCX, JPG, PNG
4. Documents are automatically processed and added to blockchain
5. Receive a unique verification ID for each document

### Verifying Documents
1. Use the verification section or click "Verify Document"
2. Enter the verification ID provided by the document owner
3. System will check blockchain and display verification results
4. Results show document authenticity, upload date, and blockchain details

### Managing Documents
1. View all your documents in the Dashboard section
2. Search documents by name or verification ID
3. Filter by category (Academic, Identity, Legal, Other)
4. View detailed document information
5. Share verification links with others
6. Download blockchain verification proofs

### User Account
1. Click "Get Started" to create an account
2. Or click "Login" if you already have an account
3. Account data is stored locally in your browser
4. Logged-in users can manage their document library

## üîß Features in Detail

### Blockchain Simulation
The application includes a simplified blockchain implementation with:
- **Genesis Block**: Initial block to start the chain
- **Proof of Work**: Simple mining algorithm requiring hash to start with '0'
- **Block Structure**: Index, timestamp, data, previous hash, current hash, nonce
- **Hash Generation**: Custom hashing function for data integrity
- **Chain Validation**: Ensures blockchain integrity

### Document Security
- **File Hashing**: Each document gets a unique cryptographic hash
- **Blockchain Storage**: Document metadata stored immutably on blockchain
- **Verification IDs**: Unique identifiers for easy document verification
- **Tamper Detection**: Any document modification would change the hash

### User Interface
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to all screen sizes
- **Smooth Animations**: CSS transitions and keyframe animations
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects, loading states, notifications
- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML and keyboard navigation support

## üé® Customization

### Styling
- Modify `styles.css` to change colors, fonts, and layout
- CSS custom properties make theming easy
- Responsive breakpoints can be adjusted for different devices

### Functionality
- Extend `script.js` to add new features
